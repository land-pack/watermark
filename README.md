# watermark
===========
This is my graduation project. I want to build a web site ,it's can register user and manager user. 
also it's have personal space. If you register the website you can upload your image for watermark.
and then, you can pick one algorithm to go. If you need to extract the watermark from the target 
image you are welcome to extract by this site! So it's should be a good place to protect your own
intellectual property right! It's use many many third party lib! For Example: `matplotlib`,`numpy`
and `Pillow`, etc!
